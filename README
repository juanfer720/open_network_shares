Usage:
 cmd> opensh.pl [ -m Machine  | -l TextFile.txt | -i IP_Address(es) ]

       -m Machine........A single machine to scan for open
                         shares.
       -l TextFile.txt...A path to a text file containing a
                         a list of machines.  This list
                         must contain a machine on each line.
                         If a machine is prepended by a \\,
                         that's ok...it will be substituted.
                         Ideally this would be a text file
                         that matches the format of the
                         'net view' command.
       -i IP_Address.....An IP address or range of IPs to
                         scan. To specify a range enter it
                         in this format: 192.168.1.2-254.
                         This would scan 192.168.1.2 to
                         192.168.1.254.

 The script will create a text file for each machine
 scanned containing log details for open shares and
 interesting files matched against.

 Examples:

  cmd> opensh.pl -m GOP21452

      *Scan for all open shares on machine GOP21542

  cmd> opensh.pl -l Machines.txt

      *Scan for all open shares for machines specified
       in the Machines.txt file.

  cmd> opensh.pl -i 192.168.1.2-254
  
      *Scan all machines assigned IP addresses 
       192.168.1.2 thru 192.168.1.254
